= ClamAV clamd signature update container

This docker container watches for changes to the clamd signature imagestream in
the cluster's registry, and when changes occur, it downloads the update,
unpacks it, and then overwrites the old signatures. Once finished with the
update, it will notify the clamd running in the oso-clamd container in the same
pod that the signatures have been updated.
