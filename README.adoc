== Description

This repository contains scripts used by OpenShift Operations for various
purposes, many of which do not pertain directly to management of OpenShift
itself.

Code here may be under heavy development, and none of these scripts are
officially supported by Red Hat.  Use at your own risk.

The repository layout is designed for use with http://rm-rf.ca/tito/[Tito]

See our https://github.com/openshift/openshift-tools/blob/prod/docs/build.adoc[Build instructions] for more information.

== Builds
RPMs from this repo can be found on our https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/g/OpenShiftOnlineOps/openshift-tools/[Copr Project].
